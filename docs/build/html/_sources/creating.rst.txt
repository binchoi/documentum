Creating Subtitles 
===================

In this section, I will just ramble This post aimed to look at the bigger picture and explain 
everything you need to do—and why—in order to document your project using Sphinx. The first 
few steps, i.e. cloning the repository, installing both a virtual environment and Sphinx, and 
setting up ReadtheDocs are one-time actions that you won’t have to think about again. Writing will 
take up most of your time (as it should). Pushing your docs to Github will become a matter of 
repeating the same steps over again.
